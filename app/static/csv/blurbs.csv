1,-1,1,1,Today we're going to talk about health. ,3:25,0
2,-1,1,1,Why don't you start off by sharing how you think about your health.,3:25,0
3,1,-1,1,My health is actually something I think about a lot these days.,3:26,0
4,1,-1,1,"After I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes during my last doctor's visit, I've become much more proactive.",3:26,0
5,-1,1,1,Tell me more about what you mean by proactive.,3:26,0
6,1,-1,1,"I started taking insulin by pump 2 months ago, and have a built-in Bolus calculator to keep track of my insulin intake.",3:27,0
7,1,-1,1,"I'm also a sucker for fast food, so I purposefully cook a week's worth of meals each Sunday to force myself to stay disciplined.",3:27,0
8,-1,1,1,"Got it, tell me about how you use the Bolus calculator.",3:27,0
9,1,-1,1,My bolus calculator tells me my blood glucose levels and how much insulin I'll need to lower those levels.,3:27,0
10,-1,1,1,How about calculating the carbohydrate ratio?,3:27,0
11,1,-1,1,Eh to be honest I kind of just guesstimate that number.,3:27,0
12,1,-1,1,"I think that's the one number my calculator doesn't show me, so I just make a rough guess.",3:28,0
13,1,-1,1,I don't always know exactly how many carbs each ingredient in my meal has.,3:29,0
14,1,-1,1,Do 5 lima beans equal 5 carbs? ,3:30,0
15,1,-1,1,"I have no clue, usually I just round up a little to make sure I take more insulin.",3:31,0
16,1,-1,1,Better to be safe than sorry right?,3:32,0
17,-1,1,1,What else do you think about in terms of managing diabetes?,3:32,0
18,1,-1,1,There's the meal planning as I mentioned before.,3:32,0
19,1,-1,1,I also visit my doctor every 2 months. ,3:33,0
20,-1,1,1,How did you decide on a 2 month rhythm?,3:33,0
21,1,-1,1,"My cousin and also a corowker, who both have diabetes, told me that they go every 2 months.",3:34,0
22,1,-1,1,So I figured they can't both be wrong.,3:34,0
23,-1,1,1,Where else do you go to for information on diabetes?,3:35,0
24,1,-1,1,"I go to my cousin a lot, though he hasn't figured out that carb ratio calculation either",3:35,0
25,1,-1,1,Then there's this great forum online called Reddit where I can follow what people have to say about diabetes.,3:36,0
26,-1,1,1,What type of information do you search for?,3:37,0
27,1,-1,1,"I sometimes browse around just to read about other people's stories, especially survivors. ",3:37,0
28,1,-1,1,But what I really get excited about are Diabetes-friendly recipes!,3:37,0
29,1,-1,1,"Food is very important to me, and I used to get down on myself because I was cut off from certain foods.",3:38,0
30,1,-1,1,But I've been very inspired by some of the recipes I've seen on there.,3:38,0
31,-1,1,2,Today we're going to talk about health. ,12:03,0
32,-1,1,2,Why don't you start off by sharing how you think about your health.,12:03,0
33,2,-1,2,I've kind of stopped thinking about it.,12:03,0
34,-1,1,2,Why is that?,12:03,0
35,2,-1,2,I just get so frustrated.,12:04,0
36,2,-1,2,"Ever since I got diagnosed with Diabetes, my life has never been the same.",12:04,0
37,2,-1,2,I got laid off at my job and am now uninsured so I can't afford an insulin pump.,12:04,0
38,2,-1,2,I'm no longer eligible to collect unemployment so I took out a loan to cover the daily insulin injections that I have to do myself.,12:05,0
39,-1,1,2,"Since you're doing injections on your own, can you walk you through the calculations you do?",12:05,0
40,2,-1,2,That's another thing that frustrates me to no end.,12:06,0
41,2,-1,2,"I've been doing the calculations manually for about 8 months now, and I still get confused.",12:06,0
42,2,-1,2,"It's too much to deal with, I was never good with numbers too.",12:07,0
43,2,-1,2,"My doc gave me a cheat sheet, which helps a tiny bit, but it's still a lot. ",12:07,0
44,2,-1,2,I always keep a calculator in my purse...it's my old calculator from my grammar school days.,12:07,0
45,-1,1,2,What would help you most in this process?,12:08,0
46,2,-1,2,"If you really want to know, I wish I would just win the lottery so I could afford an insulin pump, and a nice house on Cayuga Lake.",12:08,0
47,2,-1,2,"But if I can't do that, it would be great to have an easier way to do these gosh-awful calculations.",12:08,0
48,2,-1,2,Maybe even I just type in a few numbers into some tool and it spits out the amount of insulin I need to take. ,12:09,0
49,-1,1,2,Thanks for sharing. ,12:09,0
50,-1,1,2,How do you currently find information on Diabetes?,12:10,0
51,2,-1,2,I know it's bad but I just try to forget about it.,12:10,0
52,2,-1,2,"Everytime I think about it, it just depresses me.",12:11,0
53,2,-1,2,"I honestly don't know where I would look, even if my life depended on it.",12:12,0
54,-1,1,2,Tell me about the people in your life that are involved in your diabetes management.,12:12,0
55,2,-1,2,"I live with my son and the love of my life, Jessie.",12:13,0
56,2,-1,2,My son helps me stay on track since I often forget.,12:14,0
57,2,-1,2,Jessie is mostly there for morale support.,12:14,0
58,2,-1,2,"By the way, Jessie is a golden retriever, a beautiful one at that.",12:15,0
59,-1,1,3,Today we're going to talk about health. ,8:53,0
60,-1,1,3,Why don't you start off by sharing how you think about your health.,8:53,0
61,3,-1,3,I'm really attuned to my health for a few main reasons.,8:53,0
62,3,-1,3,"My father passed away last year due to complications related to Diabetes, the same kind I have actually.",8:54,0
63,3,-1,3,"Also, my schedule is just so busy as a tech entrepreneur that I can't afford to miss a day of work to do doctor's visits.",8:54,0
64,3,-1,3,"So ever since I got diagnosed with Diabetes I've been on edge a little, but overall it's been manageable.",8:55,0
65,-1,1,3,Got it. Now walk me through the daily lifecycle of your insulin intake.,8:55,0
66,3,-1,3,"I set an alarm for my daily pump, which happens just before dinner at 6PM.",8:56,0
67,3,-1,3,"I login to this app I found, which asks me for a few numbers.",8:56,0
68,3,-1,3,I input the numbers and it spits out how much insulin I need to intake through the pump.,8:56,0
69,3,-1,3,"Then, I type in that number in the insulin pump and I'm done.",8:57,0
70,-1,1,3,"As a follow-up, walk me through how you find information on Diabetes.",8:57,0
71,3,-1,3,I've developed a pretty good system of checking in with a support group on a weekly basis.,8:58,0
72,3,-1,3,"I go to this community center in Milipitas for tech entrepreneurs with Diabetes, it's been super helpful to know that I'm not alone.",8:58,0
73,3,-1,3,We share resources and our stories.,8:58,0
74,-1,1,3,Could you please elaborate on these resources?,8:59,0
75,3,-1,3,"Yeah, they're mostly news articles and health reports on treating Diabetes.",8:59,0
76,3,-1,3,"Sometimes we share new apps or other tech, but there isn't anything really focused on solving for those afflicted with Diabetes.",8:59,0
77,-1,1,3,What do you think would solve the needs of those afflicted with Diabetes?,9:00,0
78,3,-1,3,I think it'd be cool if there was some sort of insulin pump that could automatically do these calculations for me.,9:00,0
79,3,-1,3,It would read your blood glucose level. ,9:01,0
80,3,-1,3,"You then enter what you're about to eat in non-mathy terms, such as 1 slice of cheese pizza or 1 bowl of rice and 2 jalapeno poppers.",9:01,0
81,3,-1,3,"Then it would seamlessly convert that to the carbohydrates you plan to consume, and calculate a carb ratio that determines your insulin intake.",9:02,0
82,3,-1,3,It would then communicate with the insulin pump and feed you that required amount.,9:02,0
83,3,-1,3,"I haven't seen technology that can support this task yet, but I think it would solve my pain of having to manually think about my daily intake.",9:02,0
84,3,-1,3,"On average, it takes me about 15 minutes per day to complete the process.",9:03,0
85,3,-1,3,"But if you expand that out to a year, I did the math - it's 5,475 minutes or 91 hours every year.",9:03,0
86,3,-1,3,"I earn about $200 per hour, so the cost savings would be more than $18,000.",9:03,0
87,3,-1,3,That's equivalent to two 1st class flights to Rio!,9:04,0
88,-1,1,3,Thanks for sharing your insight on that. ,9:04,0
89,-1,1,3,Anything else you want to share?,9:04,0
90,3,-1,3,"Nah, I think that's it. ",9:05,0
